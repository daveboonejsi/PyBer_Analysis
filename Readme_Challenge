# PyBer_Challenge

## Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type.

Drivers make more money per ride in rural areas.  Fares per ride cost more in rural areas.  But there are far fewer total rides in rural areas.
Most of the PyBer's money is made in the Urban areas.

## Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week.

Fares are pretty constant from January to April.  Urban rides have greater volume followed by suburban and then rural.
